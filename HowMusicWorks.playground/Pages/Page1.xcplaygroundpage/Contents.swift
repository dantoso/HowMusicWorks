 # Hey there!
 
 Here I'll be trying to explain how western music notes work!
 \
 To be more especific, I want to show you how a simple combination of sound frequencies can make you feel things. And then show you how, in the west, people made a tuning system based on this observation.
 
## Let's play with frequency!
 
 When you execute this playground there is a slider where you can control the frequency of a sound wave, this wave goes from 0 Hz to 1200 Hz (0 vibrations per second to 1200 vibrations per second).

 - Experiment:
 Tap the wave to start or stop the sound from playing and move the slider around to change the sound pitch/frequency.
 
Try to notice this:
 * Just letting the slider sit still doesn't make you feel anything.
 * But moving it around probably does!
 
 - Important:
 A constant pure wave of sound doesn't make you feel anything, but the variation of frequency over time does!
