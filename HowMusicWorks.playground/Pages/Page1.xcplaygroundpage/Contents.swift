 # Hey there!
 
 Here I'll be trying to explain how western music notes work!
 \
 To be more especific, I want to show you how a simple combination of sound frequencies can make you feel things. And then show you how, in the west, people made a tuning system based on this observation.
 
***
 
 ### Why understanding this?
 
 Usually we don't pay attention to the inner working of everyday things, and sometimes, when we do, we end up learning a lot from an apparently very simple question! (Also, its always a very good feeling when you discover something new). I hope that here you can have a little of that feeling :)
 ***

## Let's begin!
 
 So, to understand **how music works** we first need to define **what music is**, and since music is a form of art, everyone kind of has their own definition. So, this is my definition for what music is:
 
 - Note:
 Music is any sound or combination of sounds that makes us feel things.
 
 ***
 ## What is sound?
 
 Now that we defined music, we also need to define **what is sound**.

 - Note:
 Sound is a vibration that propagates through the air, its an acoustic wave!
 
 So to really understand what sound is, here is a little interface that you can toy with.
 
 ***

 ## Interact!
 
 When you execute this playground there is a slider where you can control the frequency of a sound wave, this wave goes from 0 Hz to 1200 Hz (0 vibrations per second to 1200 vibrations per second).
 
- Note:
 With this you can change a sound frequency and it will show a visual representation of the sound wave you are generating, the wave seen is just a visual representation but it is proportional to the sound frequency you're listening.
 
 - Experiment:
 Tap the wave to start or stop the sound from playing and move the slider around to change the sound pitch/frequency.
 
With this experiment I want you to observe that:
 * Just letting the slider sit still doesn't make you feel anything.
 * But moving it around probably does!
 
 - Important:
 Which means, a constant pure wave of sound doesn't make you feel, but the relation between two or more sounds does! That is what makes us feel, the interval between frequencies played!
