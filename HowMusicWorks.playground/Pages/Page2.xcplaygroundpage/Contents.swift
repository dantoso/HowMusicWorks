 # What if we played two sounds at the same time?
 
 Very good question! Here I have another cool interface for you.\
 The white waves are all pure waves you can control with sliders.\
 They are added together to form the blue wave in the bottom.
 Like before, the blue wave is a button that represents the sound you can listen to (by tapping the wave).
 
 - Experiment:
 Try to observe how different combination of frequencies makes you feel different things. You can make a white wave not vibrate by making it vibrate in 0 Hz, this way you can observe how two waves alone make you feel, before you add the third.
