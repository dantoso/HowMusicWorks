 # What if we played two sounds at the same time?
 
 Very good question! Here I have another cool interface for you.\
 Like before, here you'll be controlling wave frequencies with sliders, but now you control the frequency of 3 pure waves.\
 These waves are added together to form a fourth wave in the bottom, which is not pure.\
 Last but not least you can play a sound which corresponds to the wave you built in the bottom.\
 Like before, all of it changes in real time!
 
 - Note:
 You can make a white wave not vibrate by making it vibrate in 0 Hz, this way you can observe how one or two waves alone make you feel, before you add the second or third.
 
 Now observe that is not only the variation of sound through time that makes us feel things, two frequencies played at the same time do too.\
 
 In the next page I'll show you how Pythagoras figured tuning out. He observed that frequencies that related to each other in certain ratios make us feel a variation of comfort to discomfort.\
 Try to see if you can find some nice sounding ratios!
 
 - Experiment:
 A little hint: try to play a frequency and 2 times that frequency and go from there.
