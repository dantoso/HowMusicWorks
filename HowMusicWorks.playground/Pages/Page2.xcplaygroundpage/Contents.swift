 # What if we played two sounds at the same time?
 
 Very good question! Here I have another cool interface for you.\
 The white waves are all pure waves you can control with sliders.\
 They are added together to form the blue wave in the bottom.
 Like before, the blue wave is a button that represents the sound you can listen to (by tapping the wave).
 
 - Note:
 You can make a white wave not vibrate by making it vibrate in 0 Hz, this way you can observe how one or two waves alone make you feel, before you add the second or third.
 
 Now observe that is not only the variation of sound through time that makes us feel things, two frequencies played at the same time do too.\
 
 In the next page I'll show you how Pythagoras figured tuning out. He observed that frequencies that related to each other in certain ratios make us feel a variation of comfort to discomfort.\
 Try to see if you can find some nice sounding ratios!
 
 - Experiment:
 A little hint: try to play a frequency and 2 times that frequency and go from there.
