 # Pythagorean tuning
 
 A long long time ago, Pythagoras (a very smart greek guy) noticed that the pitch of a sound was determined by the size of the thing vibrating to produce the sound.\
 Along with that, he also noticed that when two things, one twice the size of the other, vibrate together, they make a very pleasing sound.
