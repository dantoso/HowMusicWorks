# Sounds and feelings

Hey there! This is the project I've submmited to WWDC 2022, it's a very short app, but it was a very big challenge for me to make it and I'm very proud of it.

The goal of my app is to show you how music works in a fundamental level, how sound waves make us feel things

## What exactly is it?

It's a sound frequency generator with a graphical interface that can be edited in real time. 
You can control 3 sound waves that are added up to form a resultant wave, you can listen to this wave at the same time that you see its form drawn on the screen. The waves' frequencies can be controlled by sliders, pickers and buttons. The app has 4 pages, each one with a different wave controller interface.

In each page there is also an info button that you can tap to read some text to learn about the basics of tuning systems, every text is related to the page you access it from.
It's really cool to toy with it, I promise.

## How does it work?

Well, the code is all here, but here's a little of onboarding.
