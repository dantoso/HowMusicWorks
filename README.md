# Sounds and feelings

Hey there! This is the project I've submmited to WWDC 2022, it's a very short app, but it was a very big challenge for me to make it and I'm very proud of it.\n

It's a sound frequency generator with a graphical interface that can be edited in real time. 
You can control 3 sound waves that are added up to form a resultant wave, you can listen to this wave at the same time that you see its form drawn on the screen.
It's really cool, I promise.

## How does it work?

The code is laid bare for you to see here, but the app can be separated in 3 parts.
